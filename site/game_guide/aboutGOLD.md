Every website should have an about section and while this is pretty straightforward as to what we are about, we will go into detail about what our future goals are and the journey that got us to this point.

### What is GOLD?

**GOLD** is an Ethereum-based token designed with inspiration from Runescape's iconic in-game currency system. It introduces a unique approach to tokenomics by integrating higher buy and sell fees that serve multiple purposes: promoting larger buys, discouraging sniper bots, and encouraging long-term investment.

#### Key Features of GOLD

1. **High Buy and Sell Fees**: GOLD implements higher buy and sell fees to minimize low-volume transactions and sniper bots that exploit smaller trades. These fees act as a barrier for small trades, promoting larger buy-ins and fostering long-term holding. This structure supports the token’s stability and growth.

2. **Deflationary Mechanism**: GOLD employs a buy-and-burn mechanism, where a portion of the fees incurred from transactions is used to buy and burn tokens. This deflationary model reduces the total supply of GOLD over time, making the token more scarce, which can drive up its value as demand increases.

3. **Promoting Long-Term Investment**: The higher transaction fees discourage quick selling, encouraging investors to hold their tokens for longer periods. This helps create a more stable market, minimizing price volatility and shifting the focus towards long-term growth.

4. **Anti-Bot Strategy**: By discouraging smaller trades, GOLD reduces the effectiveness of sniper bots, which typically exploit price fluctuations with high-frequency, low-volume transactions. The high fees act as a natural defense, preserving the trading experience for genuine investors.

### GOLD in the Ethervista Ecosystem

Built on the Ethereum blockchain, GOLD seamlessly integrates with **Ethervista**, utilizing the platform’s decentralized features to ensure transparent and fair token operations. All transaction fees are paid in native ETH, promoting sustainability for both liquidity providers and the protocol itself. The deflationary nature of GOLD further strengthens its value proposition by reducing the token supply over time, which encourages long-term investor confidence.
